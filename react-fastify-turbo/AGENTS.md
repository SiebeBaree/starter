# %APP_NAME%

<TODO: write a one or two paragraph description of the app here, including what it does and what problem it solves.>

## This codebase

Turborepo monorepo: a Vite + React Router SPA (`apps/web`), a Fastify api (`apps/api`) and shared packages under `packages/`. The two apps deploy separately (on Vercel) and talk cross-origin.

## Principles

- Yagni. Fight for the smallest change that makes the behavior correct. Do not add abstractions for imagined futures and do not preserve complexity just because it exists.
- Typesafety over defensiveness. `any` is banned (lint enforced). The contract schemas are the single source of truth; if web and api disagree about a shape, the fix is in `@repo/contracts`, never a local cast.
- Comments only for what the code cannot show: framework magic, security trade-offs, policy, traps. Never restate the code. No em-dashes and no oxford commas anywhere, including comments.
- Run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm format` at the repo root before finishing any change. Lint warnings fail the build on purpose.
- Do not create documentation files (README, docs/) unless explicitly asked.

## Glossary

- **Contract**: a Zod schema in `@repo/contracts` describing the wire format of one api input or output (dates travel as ISO strings). The api validates requests and serializes responses against it; the web parses every response against it. Both sides import the same object.
- **Module** (api): a vertical slice under `apps/api/src/modules/` with routes (schemas from contracts), a service (logic and not-found semantics) and a repo (database access). Registered as an encapsulated Fastify plugin.
- **Feature** (web): the mirror slice under `apps/web/src/features/`, owning its TanStack Query hooks (`api.ts`) and components. Routes compose features, never implement them.
- **Internal package**: a `@repo/*` workspace package that ships raw TypeScript source, compiled by whoever consumes it. Nothing under `packages/` has a build step.
- **Endpoint**: one route in an api module, defined by its contract schemas. Adding an endpoint means contract first, then route, service and repo.
- **Hook**: a TanStack Query hook in a feature's `api.ts`. Components never fetch directly, they call hooks.

## How a change flows

Contracts first, then api, then web. Add or change the Zod schema in `@repo/contracts`, implement the module route against it, then consume it from the web feature through the api-client. The type provider makes an api handler that violates its declared response schema a compile error and response serialization validates it again at runtime. For breaking contract changes use expand-contract: add the new field alongside the old one, deploy, remove the old field only after old bundles have drained. A one-step rename is exactly the deploy-skew bug the Sentry report exists to catch.

## Testing: when and what

The api's real surface is HTTP, so modules are tested by injecting requests into a fully built app backed by PGlite (an in-memory Postgres running the real migrations). That covers routing, validation, serialization and SQL in one honest test; write one per meaningful behavior of an endpoint, including the interesting rejections. A service function earns its own unit test only when it contains logic worth isolating, a passthrough does not. On the web, test contract schemas at their edges, real logic in lib and dumb components with behavior worth pinning; hooks wired to TanStack Query are covered by the e2e journey, not by mocking the query client. The root Playwright suite is for critical cross-app flows, a handful at most, running against production builds. Do not write smoke tests that assert a page renders, regression tests for deleted features or tests that mock half the app; if a test needs heavy mocking, the seam is wrong.

## Things you need to know

- The api is built for dependency injection: `buildApp` receives the database, logger and config, which is what lets tests swap in PGlite. Keep new cross-cutting concerns injectable the same way.
- Fastify scoping matters: cross-cutting plugins use `fastify-plugin` to escape encapsulation and the error handler must be registered before the route modules, or child scopes keep the default handler.
- The web is a pure SPA (`ssr: false`). No server code, no secrets; everything prefixed `VITE_` is inlined into the public bundle at build time.
- The api has no build step. Locally tsx runs the TS source; on Vercel the Fastify preset compiles the source in place and invokes the handler default-exported from `app.ts` (the builder's entrypoint), while `listen` only runs when `server.ts` is executed directly.
- Shared dependency versions live in the pnpm catalog; new packages that also use them should reference `catalog:` instead of pinning their own copy.
- Production api logs are plain JSON on stdout for the Vercel Axiom drain; pretty printing exists only under `NODE_ENV=development`. Never add a log shipper to the code.
- Builds without an environment use `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` (api) and `VITE_SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` (web). Never weaken a required env var to optional to make a build pass; the fail-fast is the point.
- Formatting is oxfmt's job from the repo root, including import order and Tailwind class order. Lint rules live in `@repo/oxlint-config` so all packages stay on one rule set.
- There is no auth by design (the provider choice varies per project). The api's plugin chain is where a decorator would go; protect routes per module.
- The e2e todos flow needs `DATABASE_URL`, skips itself without it and deletes its own `e2e %` rows. The web smoke spec runs regardless.
